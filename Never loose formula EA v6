Notes: 

11-27-17 7:30pm
so I found that the main order get info that was on the original was not actually gathering info so I put the info
in the TotalOrdersCount function.. that opened up the order.. however I found a bug.. I ntoiced that the 
modeType avriable was changing.. which it should just be set once with what ever the main order type is.
and I think it changed to what the last pending oder was after it entererd and then changed from a Sell
fromt the first test order to a buy which was B1 & S1 = B  instead of B1 & S1 = S fromt he sell code part
I am waiting for another order to be placed to test it.. 

update: so i found a copy-paste error on the sell of both modes.. lets see.. the order entered as soon as I correceted the sell ont he buy mode.. need more
         workign examples to provde its fixed...


after the top is verifed correct this is next.
note: just realized i need a way to check to see if a TP or an SL is hit and close out all the other pending orders if there are any..

11-28-18 8:26am
I belive i fixed the pending order issue.. now i need to have some sucessful tests of it while i wait for fxchoice..
also need to look into the main EA (pr parent EA if u will ) of this to see y the TP is not 210 like its supposed to be!




update:  so I found that the main closed out but the B NLF didnt close.. so I have to come up with a way to close all if one is closed
         so i am thinking about usign the original history idea.. so if there is a new hisoty with the magic number.. then close all
         all open and closed witht he magic number. thought about checkign history for the main but the NLF orders migth close before it
         so checking history for a change in orders is the proper way to go.. tried checking the history.. the way its implented below
         does not work.. it closes the pending orders each time.. fail! this is going to be interesting. I think i got the pending orders to
         close but the open NLF buys or sells will be a problem.. how can the computer tell if an order hit TP? but wait..  if done correcltly,
         which it think this is doing, the TP of one order would be the SLs of the others.. thus all the orders whould close at the same
         time.. the issue might be with the ASK line. the spread might have to get calculated into the opens to make sure that the
         orders all close out togther.. lets see what happends with the current buy.. it should work like the teacher said then the working
         clean up of pending orders should be all I need.. 
         
update: found that the main would not clear .. so I added a check if there are no buys or sells then clear out the main veriable.. seams to work well.
         now i need more test on this. ok I updated the code with the check rigth at the pending order count below.. needs more testing
         but it seams to be workign well..
         
         
11-29-17 10:21am

sooo.. it dont seam like it would work but it does the Never loose formula does work.. seams like as the NLF order gets closer to closing... the gap 
starts to close until its a few dollars in profit... hence.. never loose.. 
UPDATE: so the EA entered the trade the NLF EA found it.. entered the NLF sell and once that entered ened a pending buy... the NLF hit TP and then the 
        original hit SL. all open orders closed. in the next bar, the NLF EA found no open jobs and close out the remaining pending.. was not
        imideate on the main closing.. that must be due to slippage. the closing the the pending was perfect!!
        Needs more examples to say its work.. so far.. it is! I am going to add in a check for pending just in case so that a NLF order does not
        get mistaken for a main order,         
        
UPDATE: found some huge codingissues in the sell mode.. its a miricle that any sells orders opened on the sell mode..
         the code should be working now.. need to see what happends.. waiting for the next trade..
        so I am goign to have to add a check to see if the correisponding pending order enters 1st before addign the SL to the main order
        that or a way not to try to open the order until the price is blow a certain point so to remove the errors i am getting
        if it does not clear out the main this time, i will change the else ifs back to elses.. 4:52pm
       
         
MIAN EA: I have confirmed that the issue is that the main EA's TP is less then 210 which makes all the NLF's TPs/SLs off as well.

I need to add a check for the commenr.. I wanr to see if it can be used as a filter.. if so.. then mybe close out all the remining orders   

12-2-17 12:51pm - have put in a check comment for the buys and sells count to see if that way we can verify that a NLF order is not
            mistaken as a main.. i dont want to close out any open NLF ordersebacuse  it hink its the bad spread of this broker and
            massive slippage that makes it not orderable.. I have an idea .. im wonderig if the slippage is too big and its y the
            orders are not opening?  I have also try to open an order at 1.95 lots.. it should no t be a problem but I just
            want to eliminate all possible causes..
            

12/3/17 11:23pm

i found that i cant even maually open a 1.95 lot.. there is only x.x lots mot x.xx lots
so I changed the last wave 5 to be 2 lots not 1.95 .. should be the same even alittle better if hit!
